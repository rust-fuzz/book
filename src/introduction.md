# Introduction

[Fuzz testing][] is a software testing technique used to find security and stability issues by providing pseudo-random data as input to the software.

[Rust][] is a high performance, safe, general purpose programming language.

This book demonstrates how to perform fuzz testing for software written in Rust.

There are two tools for fuzzing Rust code documented in this book: **[afl.rs]** and **[cargo-fuzz]**.
